# Classic Offensive: Exiled

After being rejected from Steam, we've decided to opt for an alternative way of distributing Classic Offensive to the public with the ability to autoupdate, in a similar fashion to other Valve mods that were also rejected.

This will be the official way to install and play Classic Offensive until hopefully the situation is resolved.
